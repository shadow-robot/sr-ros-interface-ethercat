# Joint to actuator mappings
Contains the different mapping files for joint to motor/muscle.

The mapping for a particular hand should be specified in the general_info.yaml file in [sr_hand_config's](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_hand_config.git) dedicated folder. 

The use of an incorrect mapping could cause damage to the hand. If you are uncertain as to which mapping file should be used for your hand, please contact production@shadowrobot.com.
