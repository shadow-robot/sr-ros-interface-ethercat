\item \textbf{09/08/2012 - release 1.0.0}: Using lowpass filter instead of alpha-beta filter for better control, added support for three finger hands, Control inputs from the host (backlash compensation on/off, sgl increase, jiggle, write eeprom, ...), Switching from PWM demand to TORQUE demand on the fly. Added a service to nullify the demand sent to the motor easily. This way the user can easily stop the control of the hand. Rewrote bootloader
