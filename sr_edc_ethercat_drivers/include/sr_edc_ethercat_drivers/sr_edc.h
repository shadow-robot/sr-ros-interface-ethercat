 * @brief This is a parent class for the ROS drivers for any
 * Shadow Robot EtherCAT Dual CAN Slave.
 * It provides the tools to reprogram the Firmware of the microcontrollers
 * on the boards attached to the CAN busses of the Shadow EDC device
 * (like e.g. the motor boards, or the valve control boards),
 * assuming that they use the simplemotor-bootloader protocol implemented here.
